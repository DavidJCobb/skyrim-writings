<h1>Form versions 43 and 44</h1>
<p>
Ever since Skyrim Special Edition's release and with it, the release of several improperly ported Skyrim Classic mods, the community has paid close attention to form versions, the version numbers embedded into every record in an ESP file. It's widely understood that version 43 is specific to Classic and heralds Doom and Death, while version 44 is specific to Special and is Right and Pure. There are xEdit scripts for scanning your load order in search of any version 43 content, and many authors field complaints from users about such content. Yet scattered findings and observations around the community paint a more complicated picture, and suggest that version 43 content isn't inherently dangerous.
</p>
<p>
This document aims to bring these observations together and present a clearer picture of form versioning.  My goal was to combat misinformation which contradicts what is known through reverse-engineering, while also incorporating observations made in other scenes within the Bethesda RPG modding community by people with other specialties. During the process of writing this document, I managed to personally verify some community observations via disassembly, while also clarifying the scope and scale of other phenomena I had noticed in the past. It's my hope that this document can be as educational for others as the process of writing it was for me.
</p>

<h2>The short version</h2>
<ul>
<li>Version 43 data is only harmful in specific situations. It's not radioactive in the way that much of the community seems to believe.</li>
<li>Version 43 data is only different from version 44 data in places where Skyrim Special Edition actually adds new features, and in a small number of places where Bethesda made some very specific mistakes. Bethesda worked hard to make sure that Skyrim Special would properly handle Skyrim Classic data in every case where Bethesda wasn't actually adding new features or functionality.</li>
<li>Even official game files for Skyrim Special Edition contain a mixture of data in versions 43 and 44. Forms in official files are read in exactly the same way as forms in modded files, so what works in the former will also work in the latter.</li>
<li>Re-saving a file in the Creation Kit is the recommended way to port mods between Skyrim Classic and Skyrim Special.</li>
<li>However, without community fixes, re-saving a file in the Creation Kit won't properly convert <em>all</em> data, because Bethesda made some mistakes in specific places.</li>
<li>There are xEdit scripts out there that can scan your load order and find all mods that contain version 43 data. As of this writing, these scripts are not advanced enough to identify when that data is actually <em>out of place.</em> Do not assume that everything found by these scripts is broken.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the basic differences between form versions 43 and 44?</h2>

<p>The main differences between form versions 43 and 44 are:</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      Skyrim Special Edition allows certain form types to specify new data, to 
      control new features.
   </li>
   <li>
      Bethesda went out of their way to try and maintain backward-compatibility for 
      most data, but they made one or two specific mistakes.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   This means that data for version 43 is identical to data for version 44 when 
   all of the following are true:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      The form type in question has not had its format deliberately changed by 
      Bethesda.
   </li>
   <li>
      Bethesda did not make mistakes when writing the code to load the form type.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   And indeed, if you check the official game files  &mdash;  Dragonborn.esm and 
   such &mdash; you'll see both version 43 and version 44 forms inside. Though the 
   publicly-available Creation Kit appears to upgrade the version numbers on all 
   forms when re-saving content, it seems that during development, Bethesda only 
   changed the version numbers on forms whose structure or content actually needed 
   changes.
</p>
<p>
   We'll go over Bethesda's efforts to maintain backward-compatibility, and the 
   few mistakes they made in doing so, in a later section.
</p>

<h2>What are the differences between forms in official content and forms in mods?</h2>

<p>
   There are none. Some mod authors have claimed that Skyrim Special Edition uses 
   special behavior for the official files only, so that those files can have data 
   in version 43 but mods cannot. This is not true. Forms in official content are 
   loaded the same way as forms in modded content.
</p>
<p>
   There are a few reverse-engineers in the community who have analyzed Skyrim's 
   compiled code in order to determine how it works &mdash; and how to tamper with 
   it, to make mods that can't be made with the Creation Kit and Papyrus scripting 
   alone. I happen to be one of them. I'm currently working on making my own tools 
   for editing mods, and as part of that process, I've been reverse-engineering 
   how the game loads forms. My focus is on Skyrim Classic, but I've occasionally 
   cross-referenced against Skyrim Special itself and against the findings of the 
   reverse-engineers who specialize in Skyrim Special.
</p>
<p>
   The basic process that the game has for loading forms is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      Check if a form with this ID already exists: are we loading an entirely new 
      form, or an override?  If it's a new form, then we need to create a form in 
      memory to hold the data; if it's an override, however, then we already have a 
      form in memory, so we're going to ask that form to clear out all of the data 
      it's loaded before and reset itself.
   </li>
   <li>
      Once we have a form in memory, with some nice, blank data, we can then call a 
      function on that form to load the data &mdash; a <dfn>virtual function</dfn>, 
      which is just computing jargon for, "We ask the form to do something, and it, 
      not us, decides how it's gonna do the thing." There are over a hundred and 
      twenty different kinds of forms in Skyrim, and each of them knows how to load 
      itself.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   There are a few extra details, for things like the Creation Kit's collaboration 
   features (which are relevant to the game as well, because the Creation Kit is 
   basically just a heavily hacked copy of the game engine). There are also some 
   special cases for things like game settings (<code>GMST</code>) and NavMeshInfoMaps (<code>NAVI</code>), 
   where they either aren't "real" forms or are otherwise handled in very unique 
   ways. The vast majority of forms follow the two basic steps above, though.
</p>
<p>
   Now, let's dive into some light technical details.
</p>
<p>
   I mentioned that forms load their data using a  "virtual function."  The game 
   doesn't use the exact same code to load every form, because the forms all have 
   completely different data, often arranged in completely different ways. Rather, 
   every form type has a list of functions attached to it, and the game refers to 
   these by number.
</p>
<p>
   The seventh function in a form's virtual function list is used to load a form's 
   data from an ESP, ESM, or ESL file. Every form type has its own such function, 
   and the program is organized so that the code for loading a form doesn't have 
   to ever bother to check what kind of form it's working with. It knows that for 
   <em>whatever</em>  form it has, there will be a function list, and it just needs to 
   grab the seventh function in that list.  When reverse-engineers like me look at 
   Skyrim's code, we can actually find these lists, study the functions inside of 
   the list, and work out what each function is supposed to do.
</p>
<!-- NOTE: Computers start from zero, so it's actually virtual function 06. -->
<p>
   Skyrim's reverse-engineering community is fairly good about documenting our 
   findings, so those lists are publicly visible in places like 
   <a href="https://github.com/Ryan-rsm-McKenzie/CommonLibSSE/blob/master/include/RE/T/TESForm.h#L115" target="_blank">CommonLibSSE's source code</a>.
   As of this writing, the <code>TESForm</code> class, used as a base for all form types, has 
   in Skyrim Special and in Skyrim Classic the same number of virtual functions, 
   and all functions that have been identified across both games are an exact 
   match. There isn't some special set of functions used specifically for official 
   content only.
</p>
<p>
   This means that if a given piece of data can safely use version 43 in official 
   files, then it can safely use version 43 in mods. You might see this in cases 
   where someone uses SSEEdit to create a Skyrim Special mod from scratch, with 
   overrides of forms that were version 43 in the base game or bundled DLCs.
</p>

<h2>Bethesda made some mistakes, so the Creation Kit won't get everything right</h2>
<p>
   The correct way to port a Skyrim Classic mod to Skyrim Special Edition is to 
   re-save that mod in the Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit.  However, not all 
   of the mod's data will be properly preserved: there are specific cases where 
   Bethesda made mistakes while trying to implement backward-compatibility with 
   Skyrim Classic, resulting in unintentional changes to the file format; and 
   because these file format changes are unintentional, the Creation Kit doesn't 
   handle them entirely correctly.
</p>
<p>
   One of the known issues is with critical hit data on weapons. Every weapon can 
   optionally specify a spell that should be applied to an enemy when the weapon 
   is used to land a critical hit on that enemy. (This behavior can optionally be 
   limited to <em>fatal</em> critical hits as well.) However, Bethesda failed to maintain 
   backward-compatibility for the critical-hit data structure (<code>WEAP/CRDT</code> in the 
   file format), and so in practice the specified effect is lost. In order to gain 
   an understanding as to why, let's look at how this data is stored.
</p>
<p>
   We're going to get a bit technical here, so feel free to skip a few headings if 
   that's not your scene. Ctrl + F for "What goes wrong when we re-save a weapon?"
</p>

<h3>What are structs?</h3>
<p>
   In programming terms, a "data structure" is a collection of individual values 
   that have been grouped together, generally because they're part of some whole. 
   In C++, the programming language that Skyrim is written in, we use the term 
   <code>struct</code> for smaller, simpler data structures. Each value in a struct is often 
   called a "field" or a "member," and each field has a type and a name.
</p>
<p>
   The data structure for a weapon's critical hit data looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp">struct CriticalData {
   uint16_t damage;
   float    multiplier;
   uint8_t  flags;
   FormPtr  effect;
};</pre>
<p>
   Each field is listed as its type, and then its name, with the name being used 
   to actually work with the field when writing program code. The fields inside of 
   the critical-hit data, then, are:
</p>
<dl>
   <dt>damage</dt>
      <dd>
         The amount of critical hit damage that the weapon deals.  This is a 
         16-bit unsigned integer &mdash;  that is, a two-byte value that only 
         holds non-negative whole numbers.
      </dd>
   <dt>multiplier</dt>
      <dd>
         A multiplier used to influence how likely an actor is to land critical 
         hits using this weapon. This is a floating-point number  &mdash; that 
         is, four bytes used to encode a decimal number, such as 0.3 or -50.0.
      </dd>
   <dt>flags</dt>
      <dd>
         A set of on-or-off settings which apply to the weapon. These settings 
         are grouped into an 8-bit number, with one bit per setting. There are 
         eight bits in a byte, so this is essentially a one-byte number.
      </dd>
   <dt>effect</dt>
      <dd>
         The spell to apply to any actor that takes a critical hit from this 
         weapon. We'll talk about how this is stored later.
      </dd>
</dl>
<p>
   Each of those fields has a unique type suited to a different purpose. There are 
   integer types with different sizes, because if you only plan on storing a small 
   number, then you don't need to take up all the space needed for a large number; 
   there are also decimal number types, which are slower for a CPU to work with 
   (not on any human-noticeable timescale, but if you overuse them, it'll add up). 
   A program has to know what a value's type is &mdash; how the value is stored 
   &mdash; so that the program knows how to actually read and modify the value.
</p>
<p>
   So now that we know what a struct is, and how the critical hit data is stored, 
   we can begin to talk about what goes wrong with it.
</p>

<h3>How do forms refer to each other in a Bethesda RPG?</h3>
<p>
   An experienced Skyrim mod author or mod user will know that every piece of data 
   in the game is a "form," and every form has a unique four-byte numeric ID. If 
   you're familiar with programming, you'll also know what a "pointer" is; if you 
   aren't, let me catch you up.
</p>
<p>
   When a computer program is running, every piece of data in that program has a 
   <dfn>memory address</dfn>. This is basically a unique number that describes the 
   location of that data, kind of like how a street address is a unique number 
   that describes the location of a house. When you have two pieces of data in a 
   computer's memory, and one of them needs to refer to the other, it will usually 
   do that by storing the other piece of data's memory address. Your program needs 
   to know the memory address of a piece of data in order to work with it, so if 
   you hold onto something's address, you can access it at any time. We call this 
   held-onto address a "pointer." It "points" to some other object.
</p>
<p>
   When you have two forms in memory, then, the most efficient way for one form to 
   refer to the other is by storing a pointer to the other form. However, this is 
   only possible when both forms actually <em>are</em> in memory. If something isn't in 
   memory, then it's not going to have a memory address &mdash; it's not going to 
   have a location in memory. That leads to an interesting question: how do forms 
   refer to each other <em>while</em> they're being loaded? They use form IDs inside of a 
   file, and they use pointers inside of memory, but what do they use when we're 
   actively loading them <em>from</em> a file <em>into</em> memory?
</p>
<p>
   In programming, we can create what's called a <dfn>union type</dfn>. If a value 
   has a union type, that means that it can be one of several different things, 
   depending on what the situation calls for. Unions are very similar to structs, 
   so let's take a look at a basic example:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp">union ExampleUnion {
   uint64_t integer;
   float    decimal;
};</pre>
<p>
   If we create a variable whose type is <code>ExampleUnion</code>, then that variable can 
   hold <em>either of</em> the following values, but not both:
</p>
<dl>
   <dt>integer</dt>
      <dd>
         An eight-byte non-negative integer.  This can store any whole number 
         between 0 and 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.
      </dd>
   <dt>decimal</dt>
      <dd>
         A four-byte floating-point number. This can store decimal numbers as 
         massive as 3e38 (a three followed by thirty-eight zeroes), or as small 
         and precise as 1.1e-38. However, the further you get from zero, the 
         less precise the storage gets. They're also slower to work with if you 
         only need a whole number.
      </dd>
</dl>
<p>
   A variable whose type is <code>ExampleUnion</code>  can store an integer <em>or</em> it can store 
   a decimal number, but it cannot store both. Moreover, it needs to have room for 
   all of the things it can store. If the largest thing it can store is eight 
   bytes long, then the union needs to have eight bytes to work with, even if 
   right now it's just storing something that's four bytes.  That means that our 
   <code>ExampleUnion</code> above takes up eight bytes, because it's supposed to be able to 
   hold an eight-byte integer.
</p>
<p>
   Bethesda has a really clever union type in their code, which I called <code>FormPtr</code> 
   above. It's a union of a pointer and a form ID. The basic idea is that Bethesda 
   loads an ESP file (or ESM or ESL) in two steps. In the first step, Skyrim loads 
   all of the forms into memory, but in the places where those forms would usually 
   have a pointer, Skyrim instead just stores the form IDs that it pulls from the 
   file. Then, in the second step of the process, when all of the forms are loaded 
   into memory and it's possible to create pointers to them, Skyrim goes back over 
   all of the forms that it just loaded, swapping out those form IDs for pointers.
</p>

<h3>Okay, so what's the catch?</h3>
<p>
   On a 32-bit system, a pointer is four bytes &mdash; the same number of bytes as 
   a form ID. On a 64-bit system, however, a pointer is eight bytes. This means 
   that every <code>FormPtr</code> needs to be twice as long in Skyrim Special Edition. Now, 
   normally, that wouldn't be an issue.  After all, we're just talking about how 
   things are arranged in Skyrim's memory, and that doesn't necessarily have to be 
   how things are arranged in an ESP file.
</p>
<p>
   The thing is, Skyrim Classic often loads structs by copying them directly out 
   of a file and into memory... which means that these structs' values have to be 
   arranged the same way in a file as they are in memory. Skyrim Special <em>usually</em> 
   accounts for this by loading the structs one field at a time, but there's at 
   least one specific place where Bethesda actually forgot to do that: critical 
   hit data for weapons.  Skyrim Special and its Creation Kit  <em>also</em> blindly copy 
   that data into and out of files. This means that the way critical hit data for 
   weapons has to be arranged will actually change depending on whether it's being 
   loaded by Skyrim Classic or Skyrim Special.
</p>
<p>
   The most obvious consequence this has is that the form ID for the critical hit 
   effect now needs four bytes of padding in Skyrim Special, because the <code>FormPtr</code> 
   union is now four bytes larger. However, that form ID is at the end of the data 
   structure, so there actually isn't much of a severe consequence there; the 
   padding is missing, but the game seems to be able to cope with that just fine. 
   There's another wrinkle, though: <dfn>data structure alignment</dfn>.
</p>
<p>
   Let's look back at our struct:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp">struct CriticalData {
   uint16_t damage;
   float    multiplier;
   uint8_t  flags;
   FormPtr  effect;
};</pre>
<p>
   You might expect each of those fields to appear in the data one after another. 
   However, that's actually not as efficient as it would seem. Skyrim can actually 
   work with this struct more efficiently if it's willing to waste a little space.
</p>
<p>
   Remember what I said about memory addresses? Well, everything in a computer's 
   memory has a memory address:  if it's in memory, then it has a  <em>location</em> in 
   memory. That applies to forms, but it also applies to structs  &mdash; and to 
   the individual fields in a struct. Fields in a struct also have an <dfn>offset</dfn>, or 
   the "distance"  from their location to the struct's location. In our struct 
   above, the <code>damage</code>  field has an offset of 0: it's right at the start of the 
   struct, so there's no distance between it and the start of the struct. Now, the 
   <code>damage</code> field is two bytes long, so you'd probably expect the next field, the 
   <code>multiplier</code> field, to have an offset of 2.
</p>
<p>But there's a catch.</p>
<p>
Modern CPUs are able to work with an individual value much more quickly if that 
value is <dfn>aligned</dfn>.  This means that its offset must be a multiple of 
its size.  A two-byte value must have an offset that is a multiple of two; a 
four-byte value needs an offset that's a multiple of four; and an eight-byte 
value needs an offset that is a multiple of eight. If a field doesn't have the 
right offset, then it won't be aligned, which means it'll be slower for a CPU 
to work with.
</p>
<p>
Modern compilers will make sure that every field in a struct is aligned, by 
inserting filler between fields whenever that filler is necessary.  Let's look 
at our struct, but this time, I've indicated where the filler bytes are for 
Skyrim Classic, and I've also annotated each field with its offset:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp">struct CriticalData {
   uint16_t damage;     //  0 // two-byte value
   uint8_t  PADDING;    //  2 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    //  3 // padding byte, to align the next field
   float    multiplier; //  4 // four-byte value
   uint8_t  flags;      //  8
   uint8_t  PADDING;    //  9 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    // 10 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    // 11 // padding byte, to align the next field
   FormPtr  effect;     // 12 // four-byte value
   // End.              // 16
};</pre>
<p>
In Skyrim Classic, the <code>FormPtr</code> &mdash; the union of a pointer and a form ID 
&mdash; is four bytes, because pointers and form IDs are both four bytes, and 
the union needs room for the largest of all the values it's allowed to hold. 
Because the union is four bytes long, it needs to have an offset that's a 
multiple of four, and indeed, we can see that the padding bytes above are used 
to give it the right offset.
</p>
<p>
In Skyrim Special, pointers are eight bytes long, which means that a <code>FormPtr</code> 
also needs to be eight bytes long, and it needs to have an offset that's a 
multiple of eight. That means that we need to include four more padding bytes. 
Here's what the <code>CriticalData</code> struct looks like in Skyrim Special:
<p>
<pre class="language-cpp">struct CriticalData {
   uint16_t damage;     //  0 // two-byte value
   uint8_t  PADDING;    //  2 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    //  3 // padding byte, to align the next field
   float    multiplier; //  4 // four-byte value
   uint8_t  flags;      //  8
   uint8_t  PADDING;    //  9 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    // 10 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    // 11 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    // 12 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    // 13 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    // 14 // padding byte, to align the next field
   uint8_t  PADDING;    // 15 // padding byte, to align the next field
   FormPtr  effect;     // 16 // eight-byte value
   // End.              // 24
};</pre>
<p>We see that <code>effect</code> is now later in the data.</p>

<h3>What goes wrong when we re-save a weapon?</h3>
<p>
The problems begin when the Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit first reads our 
weapon and its critical data. Bethesda didn't <em>intentionally</em>  change the file 
format; rather, they forgot to make Skyrim Special Edition and its Creation Kit 
load the data field-by-field in order to maintain compatibility with Skyrim 
Classic. The change is accidental, so it's not handled at all.
</p>
<p>
So what happens is, the Creation Kit misreads our data. It thinks that the form 
ID for the critical effect is supposed to be four bytes later than it actually 
is, so it takes the form ID that we provide and it mistakes that form ID for 
irrelevant padding. Our data structure ends early, so the Creation Kit ends up 
treating our weapon as if we didn't specify a form ID, so there is no critical 
hit effect on our weapon anymore.
</p>
<p>
If you re-save the file in the Creation Kit, you'll end up with valid data, in 
the sense that the data will be adjusted to conform to the version 44 format; 
but that adjustment occurs after the data has already been misinterpreted by 
the Creation Kit. It will dutifully write form ID zero, the "none" ID, to our 
weapon, and if (if!) the form ID we intended is preserved at all, it will be 
lost in the padding.  The final data is in the right format, but it's not what 
the mod author intended.
</p>
<p>
Now, CK Fixes by Nukem does fix the specific issue with weapons' critical hit 
data; it patches the Creation Kit to do a proper conversion, and I strongly 
encourage installing it for that reason and others. It's important to be aware 
of the limitations of the tools we use &mdash; and of the fixes available for 
them  &mdash;  and one of those limitations is that the developer-intended 
workflow for porting mods will only work when dealing with changes and issues 
that the developer was actually aware of.
</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
Ultimately, version 43 data is not radioactive in the way that much of the 
community believes. There are many situations where it is definitively safe to 
have version 43 data in files intended for use in Skyrim Special Edition, and 
even when version 43 data is incorrect and therefore corrupt, that data is not 
necessarily guaranteed to obliterate someone's game or save files  (though 
obviously, I strongly encourage mod authors to avoid shipping corrupt data to 
their users, and I will never say that it's <em>safe</em> to supply corrupt data to 
the game).
</p>
<p>
It's common for mod authors and users alike to use scripts that are intended to 
scan a load order and identify any mods that contain any version 43 data; it's 
fortunately somewhat less common, but still too common, for users to react to 
this by immediately contacting the authors of these mods and telling them that 
they <em>absolutely must</em> resave the mod in the Creation Kit. This is 
excessive.
</p>
<p>If I must give concrete recommendations, they would be...</p>

<h3>For authors</h3>

<li>
  If you're porting a mod from Skyrim Classic to Skyrim Special, please just 
  re-save it in the Creation Kit. Make sure to install Nukem's CK Fixes first, 
  because there are actually a few pieces of data that the public Creation Kit 
  forgets to convert properly, including some weapon data.
</li>
<li>
  If you've created your content entirely in SSE-supporting tools, using SSE 
  data as a base, then you're probably fine. For example, if you use SSEEdit to 
  override data in Bethesda's official ESMs that is version 43, it's fine for 
  your override to be version 43 as well, so long as you're not adding new data 
  that takes advantage of SSE-only features  (e.g. if Bethesda were to add some 
  new subrecord, or some new format for an existing subrecord).
</li>
<li>
  If at any point you're worried that you might cause issues for people if you 
  don't re-save your mod in the Skyrim Special Creation Kit, then just re-save 
  it in the Creation Kit. Don't ship mods that you feel anxious about shipping.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>For users</h3>
<ul>
<li>
   If you see a version 43 override in a Skyrim Special Edition mod, check the 
   version on the overridden  (master) record. If the overridden record is from 
   official content and it's also version 43, then it's probably fine. If, on 
   the other hand, a version 44 record is being overridden with a version 43 
   record, then that's at least a little weird, and I wouldn't fault you for 
   reaching out to the mod's author for clarification.
</li>
<li>
   If the mod in question <em>isn't even a port</em>, and if you don't have specific 
   reason to believe that something is wrong other than the fact that a script 
   told you that the mod has <em>the bad number</em> in it, then don't panic.
</li>
<li>
  If you don't understand any of the above, then you lack the expertise needed 
  to check whether a version 43 record is likely to be harmful.
</li>
<li>
  Regardless of your expertise, if a version 43 record ever actually leaves you 
  feeling worried, then just re-save the mod's ESP file in the Skyrim Special 
  Creation Kit  (with CK fixes installed) yourself. Don't go combing your load 
  order and contacting mod authors over it unless you have a clear reason to be 
  concerned.
</li>
